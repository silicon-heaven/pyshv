API reference for SHV values
============================

The standard Python types are used always when it is possible but there is a
concept of meta data assigned to the value in SHV. To ensure that it is
supported it was required to introduce additional types. These types are all
based on :class:`shv.SHVMeta`.

.. automodule:: shv.value
.. automodule:: shv.value_tools
