Documentation here!
===================

This directory contains various documentation snippets to explain various parts
of the template. It is not intended as comprehensive introduction and a lot is
left on the reader to get from the code but it should help with some common
tasks.

The main idea behind the documentation in ``docs`` directory is:

* Create directory (e.g., ``template``) in ``docs``.

* Put the documentation (i.e., ``.rst`` files) there.

* Link the main file of the documentation from the Table of Contents
  in the ``docs/index.rst`` file (e.g., ``template/index``.)

Feel free to use how many directories for documentation is appropriate.
