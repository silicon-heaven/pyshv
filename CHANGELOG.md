- `SHVBase` now has `user_id` property that is default user ID used with `call`
  method

  with `rpctype_null`.

### Changed
- Updated `getLogR` type hint according to spefication, it is now Struct
  instead of KeyStruct.


### Fixed
- type hint for `dir` result (corrected against SHV standard).
- default parameter type hint for getters is now correctly `i(0,)|n` instead of
  plain `i`.

  decimal conversion issue
- Error reported on Python 3.12 when `RpcClientPipe.fdopen` is used
- SHV RPC Type representation for standard types `!historyRecords`, `!getLogR`.
- Usage of `SHVMethods` with parents defining private attributes

- `.app/broker` and `.app/device` were moved to `.broker` and `.device`
  according to the SHV 3.0 standard

  Signals now should be specified there and not as a separate items.

- Access level numerical values adjusted to match SHV standard
- `SimpleBase` and thus `SimpleClient` no longer provides public ability to send
  messages and signals. Instead it is now implemented as protected methods and
  implementations based on it must expose them appropriately if that is
  required.
- `.app:date` SHV RPC method to `SimpleBase`

### Fixed
- Failing import on Windows
- Subscription are now compared case sensitive (as it should have been)
- `ValueClient` documentation for `prop_change_wait` timeout parameter

- Broker now has ability to establish connection on its own instead of just
  listening for them
- `RpcClientPipe` that supports working with Unix pipes
- `RpcServerTTY` that waits for TTY to appear

### Changed
- `RpcUrl.password` is now expected to be only string and default value is empty
  string. `RpcUrl.login_type` is now `PLAIN` to be valid for default password
  value.
- `rpclogin` replaces `PLAIN` login with `SHA1` for increased security. The new
  parameter `force_plain` was added to actually use `PLAIN` anyway.

  `RpcProtocolSerial` for `RpcProtocol.SERIAL`.

- `.app/broker:mountPoints` renamed to `.app/bnroker:mounts` according to the
  standard update.

  keyword `paths` instead of `pattern` (change in SHV standard)
- Methods in `.app/broker` now have access level Super-Service according to the
  SHV standard

  level but on access the level is not verified at all and thus access is not
  limited

  that user
- `.app/broker:mountedClientInfo` is now reported by `.app/broker:dir`

- Support for UDP/IP protocol
- Initial support for Serial protocol
- Ability to reset the client connection (`RpcClient.reset`)

### Changed
- URL now uses field `location` instead of `host` as it is more descriptive
  considering the usage.
- Login is now allowed for local socket because it can be used to elevate access
  rights of some clients without need to have multiple sockets.
- `ValueClient` now caches new value for subscribed paths when `prop_get` is
  used and optionally right on `prop_set`.

   require `io.BytesIO` instead of `UnpackContext` and `PackContext`
- `RpcMessage` has now attribute `value` instead of `rpcValue` (this is
  intentional break to force users to review their code due to the type change)
- `RpcClient` methods for sending and receiving RPC messages were replaced with
  `send` and `receive` methods.
